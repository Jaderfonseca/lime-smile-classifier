# Interpreting Toy Neural Networks with LIME
*Mini-project: Can we trust a smiley-face classifier?*

ðŸ“„[Mini-report PDF](Mini-Report_LIME_Based_Analysis_of_Smile_vs._Not_Smile)
The mini-report PDF is included for quick reference in portfolio submissions. It provides a concise overview of methods, results, and key figures, without requiring readers to open the full notebook.

## Objective
This mini-project explores how a simple neural network can classify toy "smiley face" images, and applies LIME to interpret what the model is really learning.
The goal is to investigate trust, reliability, and bias in small-scale AI systems â€” and connect these insights to real-world applications such as facial recognition, medicine, and justice.

## Ethical Note

The interpretability patterns uncovered in this toy study raise broader concerns when extrapolated to real-world domains such as facial recognition and justice systems.
